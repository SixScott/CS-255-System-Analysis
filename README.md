# CS-255-System-Analysis
Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass client wanted to design a system to help improve student drivers' first time pass rate when taking the driver test. This was because there was a large amount of students who would fail their test on the first try.

What did you do particularly well?

I feel that my diagrams were done really well, I really like how each of them turned out.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would revise the System Design Document and would improve some aspects of the activity diagrams. To improve it, I would like to go into more detail or even add more to the document.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

One example of how I included the user's needs in my design was by adding separate decision trees for whether the student driver chose to login to the website and interact directly with the system, or if they chose to call a secretary and interact with the system through the secretary. It is extremely important to consider the user's needs. Businesses and clients are not going to want to work with someone who does not develop to their needs, put simply.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

When I design software, I consider what would be the most efficient code and plesent user experience. I try to put myself in the shoes of a system user and think about whether the interface I'm designing is a plesent user experience. In the future, I might begin to include more modeling in the systems I design
